                    <p class="mb-30">The main objective of this project was to complete a task using given objects. The task is one where there had to be 
                        a protagonist and antagonist who had to pass different levels to defeat the boss. 
                        <h5>Design</h5>
                      <p class="mb-30">Each character had to be designed by ourselves along with the floor map and plan. individual
                          width and height of the object mattered as those images would then be implemented in programming. For this I choose 
                          going with an individual commando where I created him using Photoshop along with the other characters.

                      <p>Some of the images are taken from : https://unluckystudio.com/free-top-down-shooterplayer-sprites/</p>
                      <h5>Programming</h5>
                      <p class="mb-30">Due to this being OOPS concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism has been used. Moreover, the bounding box has been used for 
                          object detection. Following is the structure of the code.
                      </p>

                      <div class="caption"><figcaption>Level one of game</figcaption></div>
                      <p>Each enemy has a radius in which he or she can shoot if the player is present. This is made possible with the help of creating a Bounding box for object detection. Three different levels have been implemented with a boss fight in the end.</p>

                      </video> -->
                    </div>
                    <p class="mb-30">To make different levels a 3D matrix has been made where each number in the matrix corresponds to individual objects. e.g 1 is 
                        a corner block & 0 is open space where the player can move.</p>
                      <h5>Challenge</h5>
                      <p class="mb-30"> There were multiple challenges while the development took place but the important one amongst them optimized the game. Let me explain! What happens is that when the game loads, in the beginning, all the images are rendered at their respective
                          places, but reading through that 3D matrix and simultaneously loading those images when the player is moving all over the internet might not work at the same time, due to lack of resources such as computing power or the network. All this results in is Lack of User Experience.
                          </p>
                      <h5>Solution</h5>
                      <p class="mb-30"> To resolve this the camera class has been implemented in the program, what this does is that relative to the player's position
                          it starts to load objects in the direction in which the player moves while keeping the remaining items to be loaded in the buffer memory. With the help
                          of this technique, every object isn't loaded at once but only when it is needed on the screen.
                      </p>

                    <h5>Reflections</h5>
                    <p class="mb-30">This project was one of the good projects that I had done especially because I got to learn a lot of concepts
                        through it, moreover, the game got a final grade of 95%. While there were many things which I wanted to do, due to the time constraint had to be shortened! I relied heavily on the java documentation and the forums.<br>Really satisfied with the response the professor gave.
                        </p>
